REM At Lookout, we're running a competition to educate people about locking
REM their workstations.  The rules are simple, if you see an unlocked computer
REM send '/lockme <username>' as a Slack message, and you will be rewarded
REM with a point.  The user with the unlocked machine recieves a slack message
REM instructing them on how to lock their machine.  This automates the process
REM and wins me the competition.
